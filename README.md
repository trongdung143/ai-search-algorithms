# 🧩 Maze Game with Pathfinding Algorithms

## 📌 Introduction
This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence** course at HCMUTE.  
Its goal is to simulate various **pathfinding algorithms** in a maze environment, allowing learners to visually compare how each algorithm works and performs.

Implemented algorithms:
- DFS (Depth-First Search)  
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)  
- Hill Climbing  
- A* Search  
- Greedy Best-First Search  
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)  
- Beam Search  

The graphical interface is built using **Pygame**, enabling users to create maps, add obstacles, and observe the behavior of different algorithms in real time.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize common pathfinding algorithms in a maze.  
- Allow users to create custom maps with start, goal, and walls.  
- Provide an interactive interface for studying and comparing algorithm efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Pygame** (interactive graphical interface)  
- **NumPy** (data manipulation)  
- **Queue / PriorityQueue** (for BFS, UCS, A*)  
- **Random, Copy** (maze generation and state handling)
